# robot-mine-train
A simple problem wherein I had to find the total time spent by all the robots preforming  their tasks. The solution is written in python and utilizes a prefix sum array to make it fast enough. It was tested with a maximum of 100,000 commands and took around 0.6 seconds to evaluate the results.
